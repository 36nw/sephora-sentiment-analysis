## Description

Explore customer sentiments in the beauty world with our Sephora Sentiment Analysis project. This repository contains code and analysis focused on understanding customer opinions and feedback from the "Sephora Products and Skincare Reviews (2023)" dataset obtained from Kaggle. By applying natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, we aim to automate sentiment analysis, providing Sephora with insights for informed decisions in product development, marketing, and customer engagement. Special thanks to Kaggle and Sephora for making this dataset available, fostering research in sentiment analysis. Join us on this journey into the beauty of customer feedback!

## Installation

This project requires the following Python packages:

- pandas
* numpy
+ scikit-learn
- matplotlib
* seaborn
+ nltk

Install the required packages using the following command:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on Sephora product reviews, aiming to automate the process of extracting meaningful insights from a large volume of text data. The primary objective is to develop a tailored sentiment analysis system using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest Classifier. The project focuses on providing Sephora with valuable insights into customer opinions, preferences, and feedback to enhance product development, marketing strategies, and overall customer satisfaction.

## File Descriptions

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (Sephora_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb) that includes the code related to the sentiment analysis of Sephora product reviews. The notebook covers data acquisition, exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, sentiment analysis, and the training of classification models.

## Results

The sentiment analysis models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest, achieved the following accuracy rates:

- Logistic Regression: 80.39%
* Support Vector Machine (SVM): 80.35%
+ Random Forest: 73.18%

The detailed analysis findings and visualizations can be explored in the notebook.

## Usage

To run the Jupyter Notebook, ensure that you have the required packages installed (see Installation). Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment and execute each cell sequentially.
